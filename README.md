# Email Spam Filtering System

## Summary

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process for implementing an email filtering system for customers of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The Notebook imports a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The notebook implements two supervised machine learning (ML) models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) that accurately detect spam emails so they can be filtered out of customers' inboxes.
